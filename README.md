# TicTacToe

This repository is an exercise on object oriented programming. The tic_tac_toe project allows two players to play against each other using the command terminal. To run the example game, enter this from the base of the project:

    ```language-bash
        > ruby example/example.rb
    ```

I followed the steps found on this [codequiz blog](https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-ruby/).
I included some methods to prevent the program from breaking when an invalid input is entered and a already occupied number is entered.
